                <div class=" ">
It has become common to publish scholarly objects on the web as a set of web resources, 
each equipped with an HTTP URI. A <b>scholarly object</b> typically has:
<ul>
<li>A <b>persistent identifier</b>, e.g. a <a href="https://www.doi.org/">DOI</a> or <a href="https://www.handle.net/">handle</a> expressed as an HTTP URI.
</li><li>A <b>landing page</b> that is reachable by dereferencing the persistent identifier and following HTTP redirects. 
The landing page typically describes the scholarly object and provides links to its content resources. 
In some cases, such as articles published in HTML, the landing page actually represents content of the resource. 
For simplicity, this is still referred to as the landing page. Essentially, Signposting uses the term landing page for the resource to which the object's persistent identifier resolves.</li>
<li>One or more <b>content resources</b> that provide the actual content
 of the scholarly object, such as a PDF article, a CSV dataset, a ZIPped
 software repository, a dynamically generated map.</li> 
<li>One or more <b>metadata resources</b> that describe the scholarly object in commonly used formats.</li>
<li>Other <b>identifiers</b> that pertain to the scholarly object, including:
	<ul>
		<li>Identifiers for <b>authors</b>, e.g. 
    <a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCID</a> or <a href="https://isni.org/">ISNI</a>, expressed as HTTP URIs.</li>
		<li>Identifiers of applicable <b>licenses</b>, e.g. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licenses expressed as HTTP URIs, preferably using <a href="https://spdx.org/licenses">SPDX</a> license URIs.</li>
		<li>Identifiers for scholarly object <b>types</b> expressed as HTTP URIs from commonly used vocabularies, e.g. <a href="https://schema.org">schema.org</a>.</li> 
	</ul>

             <h3><a name="signpostingmodel"></a>Signposting Modeling of a Scholarly Object on the Web</h3>
             
 <div class=" ">
A <a href="#scholobject">Scholarly Object</a> on the Web consists of a range of different kinds of resources, each with their own URI. Signposting 
interconnects these resources in an unambiguous manner by means of links with a limited set of <a href="#relation_types">link relation types</a>. 
These are some core characteristics of the approach:
<ul>
<li>
The landing page, i.e. the resource to which the scholarly object's persistent identifier resolves, takes center stage in the approach. 
Since landing pages are under control of the custodians of scholarly objects, the approach is not dependent on technical interventions 
by parties other than those custodians, e.g. repository managers.
</li>
<li>
Links with specific link relation types point from the landing page to various resources that are constituents 
of the scholarly object, e.g. <code>item</code> links point at content resources, <code>describedby</code> links point at 
metadata resources, etc. Modeling purists are known to have taken some issue with these links emanating from the landing page, 
rather than from the persistent identifier of the scholarly object. This choice is justified in two ways. 
First, it puts custodians of scholarly objects (repository managers) in the driver seat to make the required technical 
interventions without dependency on external parties. Second, the approach entails an equivalence between the landing page URI 
and the persistent identifier URI because:
<ul>
<li>
The persistent identifier URI redirects with an <code>HTTP 302 Found</code> to the landing page URI. 
In natural language, this <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-302-found">technical approach</a> 
translates to 
"You are looking for the resource identified by the persistent identifier URI. It's not here. 
But you can find it at the landing page URI."
</li>
<li>
The landing page URI links to the persistent identifier URI with the <code>cite-as</code> link relation type. 
In natural language, this <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8574">technical approach</a> 
translates, to 
"In case you want to reference the landing page, don't do so using the landing page URI. Use the 
persistent identifier URI instead.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
In order to link from the landing page to content resources, the landing page is modeled as a collection. 
This allows using links with the <code>item</code> relation type to point from the landing page to content resources, 
and the inverse <code>collection</code> relation type to point back from content resources to the landing page.
</li>
</ul>

                            <td>The value of the <code>profile</code> attribute indicates the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6906#section-3">profile</a> to which the resource that is the 
                                target of the link conforms. Generally, a profile is a syntactic and/or semantic constraint that 
                                applies beyond what can be expressed using the MIME type of the resource. 
                                The <code>profile</code> attribute is, for example, useful when different 
                                <a href="#scholobject">metadata resources</a> have the 
                                same MIME type (e.g. <code>application/xml</code>) but conform to a different schema. 
                                The value of the <code>profile</code> attribute is a URI 
                                that uniquely identifies the format (e.g. <code>XML Schema URI</code>). Note that the use of the <code>profile</code> attribute is standardized for certain MIME types, such as  
                <code>application/ld+json</code>. It is not for many others, including <code>text/plain</code>, 
                <code>application/xml</code>, and <code>application/json</code> and, as such, its use is a community convention introduced for Signposting.

                <h3><a name="bibliographic"></a>Bibliographic Metadata Formats</h3>

                <p>Currently, there are no MIME types registered to unambiguously identify bibliographic metadata formats 
                that are commonly used in scholarly communication. And several unregistered MIME types are used to 
                refer to the same format. For example, 
                BibTeX is referred to by means of <code>application/x-bibtex</code>, <code>application/force-download</code>, and <code>text/plain</code>. 
                RIS is referred to by means of <code>application/x-research-info-systems</code>, <code>application/force-download</code>, 
                and <code>text/plain</code>.</p>
                
                <p>Preferably, MIME types for bibliographic metadata formats should be 
                <a href="http://www.iana.org/form/media-types">registered</a>. 
                But CrossRef, DataCite, and mEDRA have established an interoperable 
                practice to <a href="https://citation.crosscite.org/docs.html">access bibliographic metadata using content negotiation</a> on the basis  
                of unregistered MIME types for three formats. Since Signposting is all about 
                pragmatism it uses these de-facto MIME types for interoperability; they are listed in the below table. 
                These MIME types are used in <code>describedby</code> links that point to bibliographic metadata resources 
                and should be expressed by a client in the <code>Accept</code> HTTP Request header when accessing the URI that is the target 
                of a <code>describedby</code> link.</p>

                <p>Many other bibliographic formats are in use and many share <code>text/plain</code>, 
                <code>application/xml</code>, <code>application/json</code>, or <code>application/ld+json</code> as MIME types. In order to distinguish between 
                bibliographic formats that have the same MIME type, either a dedicated MIME type should be <a href="http://www.iana.org/form/media-types">registered</a> 
                or a <code>profile</code> attribute 
                can be used on a <code>describedby</code> link to clarify the metadata format beyond its MIME type. The former allows for content negotiation, the latter does not. The below table shows how the <code>profile</code> 
                approach can be used for popular XML-based formats. Note that the use of the <code>profile</code> attribute is standardized for some MIME types, such as  
                <code>application/ld+json</code>. It is not for many others, including <code>text/plain</code>, 
                <code>application/xml</code>, and <code>application/json</code> and, as such, it is a community convention introduced for Signposting.</p>

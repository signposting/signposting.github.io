                             This page details a concrete recipe that repositories can follow to implement <a href="http://signposting.org">Signposting</a>, 
                             a lightweight yet powerful approach to increase the FAIRness of scholarly objects. 
                             <br />
                             <br />
                             Landing pages support humans that interact with scholarly objects on the web, 
                             providing descriptive metadata and links to content. These pages are not optimized for 
                             use by machine agents that navigate the scholarly web. For example, how can a robot 
                             determine which links on the myriad of landing pages lead to content and which to 
                             metadata? Signposting caters to machine agents by providing this information, and more, 
                             in a standards-based way. 
                             It contributes to FAIR's Findable and Accessible by uniformly 
                             conveying to machines 
                             what the persistent identifier of a scholarly object is, 
                             where its landing page is, 
                             where and what its content is, 
                             where metadata that describes it is, and 
                             what the persistent identifier of its author is. 
                             It conveys this by means of meaningful links 
                             that have web locations (HTTP URIs) as their target. As such it does significantly  
                             more than merely providing the 
                             information. It invites machine agents to follow the links to 
                             their target location on the web, and hopefully find further information and links there. It essentially provides them with a map to guide their 
                             travels across the scholarly web. Signposting contributes to FAIR's 
                             Interoperable through its uniform approach and because it is entirely based on widely implemented 
                             web protocols specified in IETF RFCs. As such, the interoperability that results from 
                             adopting it is not restricted to the scholarly landscape but encompasses the web at large.

                             The recipe provided in this document takes a gradual approach towards achieving FAIRness for scholarly 
                             resources by means of Signposting: 
                             <ul>
                                 <li><a href="#step1">Level 1</a> focuses 
                             on ease of implementation and requires providing a minimal set of typed links 
                             for landing pages. Despite its simplicity, it already significantly improves the ability of 
                             machine agents to navigate the scholarly web. </li>
                                 <li><a href="#step2">Level 2</a> entails providing a comprehensive set of 
                             typed links with the landing page as link origin in a Link Set and making that Link Set discoverable. 
                             It increases the action radius of machine agents that intend to explore 
                             what lies beyond a landing page.</li>
                                 <li><a href="#step3">Level 3</a> entails  providing a comprehensive set of 
                             typed links for each content resource. The links have the content resource as link origin and are 
                             provided in a Link Set that is made discoverable by the content resource. 
                             It allows machine agents to decide where to travel next 
                             when they arrived at - say - a PDF article, a CSV dataset, a ZIPped software repository, ....</li>

<h4><a name="intro1"></a>1.1. A Scholarly Object on the Web</h4>


<div class=" ">
It has become common to publish scholarly objects on the web as a set of web resources, 
each equipped with an HTTP URI. A scholarly object typically has:
<ul>
<li>A persistent identifier, e.g. a <a href="https://www.doi.org/">DOI</a> or <a href="https://www.handle.net/">handle</a> expressed as an HTTP URI.
                 <li>A landing page that is reachable by dereferencing the persistent identifier and following HTTP redirects. Note that, in some cases such as 
                 articles published in HTML, the landing page actually represents content of the resource. For the purpose of the recipe it still is 
                 referred to as the landing page.
                 </li>
                 <li>One or more content resources such as a PDF article, a CSV dataset, a ZIPped software repository, a dynamically generated map.</li> 
                 <li>Metadata that describes the scholarly object in one or more formats.</li>
                 <li>One or more authors, each of which increasingly have a persistent identifier, e.g. an 
                 <a href="https://orcid.org">ORCID</a>, <a href="https://ror.org">ROR</a>, or <a href="https://isni.org">ISNI</a> expressed as an HTTP URI.</li>
                </ul>
</div>	

                 <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="basic.png" width="500" alt="scholarly object on the web"/>
                        </div>
               <br />
   
<div class=" ">With this regard, this document uses the following terminology:
                <ul>
                <li>
                <b>Landing page</b>: The HTML page that results from dereferencing the persistent identifier 
                (e.g. DOI expressed as an HTTP URI) of a scholarly object. The landing page typically 
                describes the scholarly object and provides links to its content resources. In some cases it 
                 is a content resource itself.
                </li>
                <li>
                <b>Content resource</b>: A content resource provides the actual content of the scholarly object, 
                it is e.g. a PDF article, a CSV dataset, a ZIPped software repository.
                </li>
               <li>
                <b>Scholarly object</b>: The union of the landing page and all the content resources.
                </li>
                </ul>
</div>           
                
                <h4><a name="intro2"></a>1.2. Typed Links</h4>
                
<div class=" ">Typed links are more expressive than plain <code>href</code> links in HTML. They actually express 
                the nature of the relationship between the <b>origin</b> and the <b>target</b> of the link. The 
                <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml">IANA Link Relation 
                Registry</a> lists a wide range of relation types that are described in 
                formal specifications such as IETF RFCs. Using relation types from that Registry 
                yields web-scale interoperability and therefore the FAIR Signposting Profile builds on it. 
</div>
                
<div class=" ">There are 3 approaches to convey typed links:
                <ol>
                <li>For HTML pages: Using the HTML <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element 
                in the <code>head</code> section of the HTML.</li>
                <li>For web resources of any media type: Using <code>Link</code> in 
                the HTTP response header.</li>
                </li>
                <li>For web resources of any media type: Using a standalone document called a <code>Link Set</code> 
                 that is made discoverable by means of a typed link with the <code>linkset</code> 
                relation type. More details on <code>Link Set</code> are provided in <a href="linksetrec">Section 1.4</a></li>
                </ol>
</div>
    
<div class=" ">Approach (2) has significant advantages:
                <ul>
                <li>The approach can uniformly be used for any web resource, 
                not only for the landing page but also for any type of content resource. 
                Machine agents only need to look in one place 
                to find guidance for the next destination in their travels.</li>
                <li>In addition to being available via <code>HTTP GET</code> requests, 
                the HTTP header that contains <code>Link</code> is accessible via the 
                <code>HTTP HEAD</code> request, which only returns transaction metadata not 
                a resource representation. As such machine agents can obtain a map for their journey 
                by issuing a HTTP HEAD even against resources that have access restrictions. 
                All the while saving bandwidth and hence energy.</li>
                <li>Typed links conveyed via <code>Link</code> in the HTTP header allow to 
                explicitly indicate the origin of the link. This allows having any resource as link origin,
                not just the resource that the machine agent interacts with  
                as is the case with <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> in HTML. As a result, links provided via 
                <code>Link</code> in the HTTP header of the landing page can also contain links that  
                have content resources as link origin.
                </li>
                </ul>
</div>
                
<div class=" ">Approach (3) has the same advantages as approach (2) but additionally allows to convey large numbers of links 
without running the risk that the HTTP header becomes too large to be handled by the web server.
</div>

                <ul>
                <li>
                A Link Set is a collection of typed links, including links pertaining to the resource that 
                makes the it discoverable. 
                </li> 
                <li>
                A Link Set is made discoverable by means of a typed link with the <code>linkset</code> 
                relation type. A <code>type</code> attribute on that link conveys the media type that is 
                used to serialize the Link Set.
                </li>
                <li>
                Two approaches exist to serialize a Link Set, one using the same format as used for the HTTP <code>Link</code> header 
                (media type <code>application/linkset</code>), the other JSON-based (media type <code>application/json+linkset</code>).
                </li>
                <li>For all typed links in a Link Set, both link origin and link target must be explicitly provided and expressed as 
                absolute URIs. This allows to unambiguously interpret a Link Set without the need to 
                save contextual information such as the URI where it is published.

<h4><a name="examples1"></a>3.1. Examples Level 1</h4>

<div class=" ">At Level 1, typed links are provided in the HTTP <code>Link</code> header of the landing page and/or in 
<code>link</code> elements in the <code>head</code> section of that page's HTML. 
With the former approach, the required typed links can be conveyed in a single the HTTP <code>Link</code> header 
or using multiple <code>Link</code> headers, one header per link. When using a single <code>Link</code> header, 
line breaks must not be used as they are not allowed per <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2">RFC7230</a>; 
only whitespaces and tabs are supported as separators. Remember that typed links in the HTTP <code>Link</code> header are accessible 
via both HTTP HEAD and GET, while links in the HTML are only accessible via HTTP GET.
</div>

<br />

<div class=" ">
The below examples show responses to an HTTP GET request issued against the URI of the landing page of our fictitious scholarly object. 
In the first example, the HTTP header approach is used to convey the typed links, with all links provided in a single <code>Link</code> header. 
Note that the same links could simultaneously be provided via <code>link</code> elements in the HTML's <code>head</code>. 
In the second example, the typed links are provided in the HTML's <code>head</code> but not in the HTTP <code>Link</code> header.

<h4><a name="examples2"></a>3.2. Examples Level 2</h4>

<div class=" ">
At Level 2, a comprehensive set of typed links is made available via a Link Set document. 
To support discovery of that document, in addition to all Level 1 links, one or more <code>linkset</code> links are provided by the landing page. 
A <code>linkset</code> link can, again, be provided in the HTTP <code>Link</code> header and/or via <code>link</code> element's in the HTML's <code>head</code>. 
The below example illustrates the former approach through the inclusion of two <code>linkset</code> links pointing to different serializations of the same 
comprehensive set of links pertaining to the landing page.

<h4><a name="examples3"></a>3.3. Examples Level 3</h4>

<div class=" ">
At Level 3, each content resource uses a Link Set document to make a comprehensive set of typed links pertaining to itself available. 
To support discovery of that document, one or more <code>linkset</code> links are provided by the content resource. 
The only way to provide these uniformly for content resources of any media type is by using the HTTP <code>Link</code> header approach.
The below example illustrates this for Content Resource 1 (Article) of our fictitious scholarly object. It shows the response to an HTTP HEAD 
issued against that resource's URI.

<div class=" ">
An actual Link Set pertaining to the content resource is obtained by issuing an HTTP GET on a URI discovered as described above. 
The below examples show responses to requests issued against <code>https://example.org/linkset/7507/1/lset</code> 
(<code>application/linkset</code> serialization) 
and <code>https://example.org/linkset/7507/1/json</code> (<code>application/linkset+json</code> serialization), respectively. 
Note that, if a content resource has distinct a persistent identifier, authorship, or descriptive metadata it can be provided 
in the Link Set using <code>cite-as</code>, <code>author</code>, and <code>describedby</code> links, respectively. But such links must not be used 
if these properties are shared with the scholarly object as a whole. Note the way the anchor of each link is provided explicitly in the <code>application/linkset</code> serialization to avoid 
ambiguous interpretation.

<h4><a name="examples4"></a>3.4. Examples for the Implementation of Level 2 and Level 3 with a Single Link Set</h4>

<div class=" ">
As described in <a href="#step4">Section 2.4</a>, Level 2 and Level 3 can be implemented simultaneously by 
providing a single Link Set that contains a comprehensive set of links pertaining to both the landing page and all 
content resources. This Link Set is made available through the provision of one or more <code>linkset</code> links 
by both the landing page and each of the content resources, as shown in <a href="#examples2">Section 3.2</a> and <a href="#examples3">Section 3.3</a>, respectively.
But, when using the Single Link Set approach, the <code>linkset</code> links provided by the landing page and each of the content resources 
will have the same target URI, i.e. the URI of the single Link Set. The below examples shows the response to issuing an HTTP GET request against 
the URI of a single Link Set that provides a complete navigational map for all resources of our fictitious scholarly object. 
As indicated in <a href="#examples3">Section 3.3</a>, 
if a content resource has distinct a persistent identifier, authorship, or descriptive metadata it can be provided 
in the Link Set using <code>cite-as</code>, <code>author</code>, and <code>describedby</code> links, respectively, with the URI of the 
content resource as anchor. But such links must not be used if these properties are shared with the scholarly object as a whole. 
Note the way the anchor of each link is provided explicitly in the <code>application/linkset</code> serialization to avoid 
ambiguous interpretation.
